This is the very first article on this blog. I decided to give Hugo a try and so far I am honestly impressed by the simplicity of it. The performance is fantastic as GitHub Pages is managing the hosting for this static website. Thinking about setting up a domain name at some point, but for now ```.github.io``` is decent for an occasional writer.

The setup was pretty straightforward, as I followed the [getting started guide](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/quick-start/), found a great theme ([PaperMod](https://github.com/adityatelange/hugo-PaperMod)) and used the Github actions workflow found [here](https://gohugo.io/hosting-and-deployment/hosting-on-github/).
